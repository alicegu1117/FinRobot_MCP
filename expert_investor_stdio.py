        With the tools you've been provided, write an annual report based on {ticker_symbol}'s and {competitors}'s {fyear} 10-K report, and format it into a PDF.

        Please follow these instructions carefully:

        1. **Explain your working plan** before you begin any analysis.
        2. **Use tools one by one** for clarity, especially when requesting instructions or data.
        3. **Perform all file operations** within the directory "{work_dir}".
        4. **Display any generated image** in the chat as soon as it is created.
        5. **Competitors analysis:**
           - Strictly follow my prompt.
           - Use only data from the financial metrics table.
           - Do not repeat or reuse similar sentences from other sections; delete any such sentences.
           - Classify each statement into the appropriate section.
           - The final sentence must discuss how {company}'s performance over these years and across these metrics might justify or contradict its current market valuation (as reflected in the EV/EBITDA ratio).
        6. **Paragraph length requirements:**
           - Each paragraph on the first page (business overview, market position, and operating results) should be between 150 and 160 words.
           - Each paragraph on the second page (risk assessment and competitors analysis) should be between 500 and 600 words.
           - Before passing the file path to the tool that builds the annual report, you should check the text length of the file content and if it exceeds the maximum length, you should summarize the file content, save the summary to a new file, and pass the new file path to the tool.
           - Do not generate the PDF until all these requirements are explicitly fulfilled.
        7. **Prompt length requirements:**
           - Clear the past chat history in the prompt when you finish the annual report for one ticker symbol and start a new one.
